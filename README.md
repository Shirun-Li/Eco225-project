# week3-exercise
- Read the instruction
- Clone your assignment repository to your computer using Sourcetree
- This will create a \textbf{local} repository (a folder on your computer). Save your dataset and your future code in this folder.
- Now let's generate some code to get started:
 --  Call your data to your Jupyter Notebook
 --  Clean your data and get the relevant summary statistics (use Project One Guideline for more details)

- Commit all changes and push your code to your \textbf{remote} repository using Sourcetree
- Open Github.com and \textbf{make sure all your code and data is on your assignment's remote repository} for us to mark.
